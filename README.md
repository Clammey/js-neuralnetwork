# Included

| Languages |

| Python    |

# Installation 
If you're looking to rebuild my application, in its original glory. Follow the following:

## Requirements

You'll need a good Python3 install, along with [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

- Python3
- Pip

Once you have the packages above, I've made a convenient requirements.txt that installs all the requirement libraries to run the model!
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install mediapipe
pip install cvzone
```

```shell
python main.py
```
